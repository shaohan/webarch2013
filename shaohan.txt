1. My experience with web archtecture:
   I have written HTML, CSS, a liitle bit JavaScript/jQuary and PHP 
before. I am currently taking Database class that I hope I 
will get familiar with database management in the near future.


2. Chrome: I like the Developer Tool and sometimes use it to find out what 
kind of libraries the current web page is using. I especially like the 
color indicator of the Developer Tool that user can easily understand 
which section these codes belong to.

Safari: I like the "share" feature which located next to the search bar of 
Safari. It is convenient because when I see something interesting, I can 
just click the share icon to share the page information on either Twitter, 
Facebook or add to local bookmark or reading list.

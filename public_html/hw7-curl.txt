A:

Uncompressed
=============
To get uncompressed Yelp's homepage, I entered the following command on my local terminal:

    $ curl -v http://www.yelp.com/ > uncompressed.html

The file I got is a html file called "uncompressed.html" and the size of the file is 90kb.


Compressed
===========
To get compressed Yelp's homepage, I entered the following command on my local temrinal:

    $ curl -v -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://www.yelp.com/ > compressed.gzip

The file I got is a .gzip file called "compressed.gzip" and the size of the file is 19kb.

Since this is a zip file, I tried to extract it and got a new document file named "compressed".
The size of the file "compressed" is 89kb.

1. SELECT: How many links were added after 2013-10-14?

   Answer: 13 rows
   Queries: SELECT * FROM links WHERE created > '2013-10-14';

   Answer: 1) No   2) Atomicity

   Answer: The new count is 170
   Queries: UPDATE links SET hit_count = '170' WHERE short_url = 'azjp' AND created = '2013-03-20';
